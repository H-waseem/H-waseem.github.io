    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first project in City and my bootcamp concluding project
  is a 2D target practice game, The game's objective is to shoot the targets as fast as possible. You shoot by clicking the mouse button. There is a on screen timer which starts and stops automatically depending on what mode you are playing. There are 2 different modes in the program, the main mode is called "Blitz" in which you have to shoot 5 targets as fast as possible, the second mode is called "Quickdraw" where there is only have 1 target and can you truly test your reaction time. For new or struggling players there are also 2 assist systems to give you some help. The first assist system is a grid which shows where the possible locations of the target could appear from, the second assist sysetm is a grid sized cross-hair which helps gauge where you need to move your mouse to. There is a in-game menu which also helps and explains all these functions in a more concise way
